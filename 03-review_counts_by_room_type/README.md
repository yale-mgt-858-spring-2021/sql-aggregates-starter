Compute the aggregate number of reviews for each room type in the `stay`
table. Sort your results in descending order by number of reviews.
Compute the mean and standard deviation of prices for each room_type.
Your results should look something like this (these might not be correct
results). 

```
    room_type    | num_reviews
-----------------+-------
 Entire home/apt |   234
 Private room    |   104
 Shared room     |     9
