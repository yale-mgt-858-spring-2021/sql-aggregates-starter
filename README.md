# 

In this assignment you will write SQL query interrogating a single table,
just like the last assignment. But this time we're going to use the `GROUP
BY` and related clauses, which are often used with aggregate functions. You'd
use `GROUP BY` when you want to answer questions like "which neighborhoods
have the most AirBnB stays?" We're going to use the `airbnb_ny.stay` table
again. And, as ever, the PostgreSQL documentation is your friend 😜.


## Suggested order

We suggest you complete the questions in the following order



As you complete questions, you can mark them as complete
in this Markdown file,  but you don't have to do so.
See [this example](https://github.blog/2014-04-28-task-lists-in-all-markdown-documents/).
