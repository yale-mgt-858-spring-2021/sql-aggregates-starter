# 

In this assignment you will write SQL query interrogating a single table,
just like the last assignment. But this time we're going to use the `GROUP
BY` and related clauses, which are often used with aggregate functions. You'd
use `GROUP BY` when you want to answer questions like "which neighborhoods
have the most AirBnB stays?" We're going to use the `airbnb_ny.stay` table
again. And, as ever, the PostgreSQL documentation is your friend ðŸ˜œ.


## Suggested order

We suggest you complete the questions in the following order

- [ ] 00-neighbourhood_group_stays
- [ ] 01-neighbourhood_group_average_price
- [ ] 02-distinct_host_name
- [ ] 03-review_counts_by_room_type
- [ ] 04-avg_price_by_room_type
- [ ] 05-multinight_stays_by_neighbourhood


As you complete questions, you can mark them as complete
in this Markdown file,  but you don't have to do so.
See [this example](https://github.blog/2014-04-28-task-lists-in-all-markdown-documents/).
