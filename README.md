This assignment gives you a little more practice with joins and aggregates.
We'll be using the `airbnb_ny` and `gift_store` schemas from the previous
assignments.
As ever, the PostgreSQL documentation is your friend ðŸ˜œ.


## Suggested order

We suggest you complete the questions in the following order

- [ ] 00-neighbourhood_group_stays
- [ ] 01-neighbourhood_group_price_stats
- [ ] 02-distinct_host_name
- [ ] 03-review_counts_by_room_type
- [ ] 04-avg_price_by_room_type
- [ ] 05-multinight_stays_by_neighbourhood


As you complete questions, you can mark them as complete
in this Markdown file,  but you don't have to do so.
See [this example](https://github.blog/2014-04-28-task-lists-in-all-markdown-documents/).
