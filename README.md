In this assignment we'll continue practicing with joins and aggregates.
We'll be using the `pagila` schema in the class database. The tables
in the schema model a DVD rental store. Remember those!? 🤣 If you 
drive down Whitney you'll still find one in operation:  [Best Video](https://www.courant.com/ctnow/movies/hc-best-video-in-hamden-20160529-story.html).
Though, it is no longer a video store, but rather
[a non-profit video archive](https://www.connecticutmag.com/arts/hamdens-best-video-no-longer-a-video-store-but-better/article_0659c0d0-c2f0-11e6-96be-5fd6fe69a422.html),
coffee shop, and music venue.
It's a great place to visit!

Well, the `pagila` schemas holds movies (mostly older movies), customer,
employees, stores (locations), rentals, payments, and related data.
We're going to use these tables to answer some of the kinds of questions
in which management might be interested.  In all cases, please pay 
attention to column names and sort order!

As ever, when I inevitably find errors in this assignment, or parts of
the assignment that need clarification, I will post in slack and update
this starter code. (Of course, if you've already started, you won't see
my updates automatically! You'll have to check Slack.) I'll also update
this description on the class website.
